These pages are drafts of wiki pages intended to be companions to the [Hydra contribution guidelines](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), prepared for the Technical On-boarding workshop at [HydraConnect 2016](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016).
These pages expand on the information from multiple locations and provide more context and links for new developers
interested in contributing to the Hydra project.
