## Slack

Slack has become the primary mode of synchronous communication in the Hydra community. There is a Hydra Slack team that is used for discussion, questions, announcements, interest groups, and working groups. Topics span very general discussion to in-depth interest/working group work, from metadata work to development coordination. Anyone can create a new channel within the Hydra Slack team once they have registered for an account.

## Conferences

* HydraConnect: the annual go-to event for the entire Hydra community, primarily geared towards connecting with fellow Hydra community members to learn how they are using Hydra
* Developer Congresses: these community hackfests tend to be held 1-2 times per year, and have a strong record of delivering advances in our community codebases and helping to onboard new Hydra developers
* Other Conferences
  * Code4lib
  * LDCX
  * Open Repositories
  * Digital Library Federation Forum

## Training

* HydraCamp: for many partners, one of the first steps to joining the Hydra community was, and remains, sending a team of software developers to HydraCamp to learn the common practices of our community. We generally hold 3-4 HydraCamps per year.
