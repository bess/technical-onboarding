# Orientation: What is Hydra?

## Hydra is a framework

Hydra began its life in 2008 as a framework: a shared set of patterns and tools, primarily in the
form of Ruby code, for building repository applications atop the [Fedora Commons Repository](http://fedorarepository.org/)
and the [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) index.

## Hydra is a solution

With the emergence of [Avalon](http://avalonmediasystem.org), [Sufia](http://sufia.io/),
[CurationConcerns](http://github.com/projecthydra/curation_concerns), and
[Hydra-in-a-Box](http://hydrainabox.projecthydra.org/), we have seen adopters come to Hydra not
just for a framework to develop their own repository applications but for solutions that get them
80% or 90% or 95% of the way towards meeting their repository needs.

## Hydra is a community

Hydra is a growing and vibrant community of people, representing a diverse array of skill sets, backgrounds, and employers. None of us is paid directly by Hydra, and so we're also a community of volunteers; things happen in the Hydra community because individuals step forward to make advancements.
